# RANCiD base device type configuration.
#
# DO NOT alter the base device types, they WILL be over-written by future RANCiD
# release installations.  Customize them by creating clones in rancid.types.conf
# with a different type name.  If you override existing types, it will be harder
# to provide support to you and I will make a voodoo doll in your likeness.
